21 School project

This project is a game about ant farm. Its goal is to find the shortest path from start room to the end.

Studied:

1. Graph theory (breadth-first search, depth-first search, maximum flow problem, Dijkstra's algorithm)
2. Complex data structures(stack, turn)
3. Hashing, binary search, dynamic array (analog of a vector in C++)
3. SDL2/SDL_TTF

Use:
`make`

`./lem-in < maps/maps3.map`
