# Push swap
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.

### Studied:
- Sort (quick sort, sort by inserts, merge sort)
- Stack, struct

### Use
 - `make`

 - `./push_swap <int_arr>`

 - `./checker [-v] <int_arr>`

### Example:

`./push_swap "33 31 10 5 42 29 37 32 3 17 20 15 6 36 8 47 35" | ./checker "-v 100000 33 31 10 5 42 29 37 32 3 17 20 15 6 36 8 47 35"`
